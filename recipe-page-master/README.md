## The first recipe page

### For the first ingredient
For create this page I have used the HTML5, the CSS3 and JS vanilla. In CSS, I have used the media querry for create the responsive state, the pseudo-element ::after/::before/::marker and I have add the counter in js to the ol list with the setAttribute. 

### For the block with time information
This block is made for a move position in big screen ( in pc mode ), for this I have add a absolute position and create this effect box with a left distance use a vw , and a backdrop-effect to the shadow.

### For the numbers in ol list
I have add this number with a function in js and added this number with a attribute in a content of ::before pseudo-element to add a background-color for create this effect of box with the center number. The base ol element list with number do not accept all transforme and position. 

## For the checkbox and label
For this part, the label permet connect to checkbox with the same name/id , this effect permet to add :checked effect with click on label, is a better mode to function with small screen and for the usability. And I have used the :after for modified the style of input, it is more easy and gif more tools for aport modification. 


### Built With

I have build this project with HTML, CSS3 and Js(es6) .
